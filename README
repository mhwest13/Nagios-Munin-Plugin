    - munin-master v1.4.+
    - munin-node v1.4.+
    - Perl Module: File::Basename

2) Place plugin in /usr/share/munin/plugins
    or own personal plugin directory

    In /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/nagios
    [nagios*]
    user root
    env.binary full_path_to_nagiostats_binary/nagiostats
    env.passive off

4) Run munin-node-configure --suggest
    you can grep for nagios_multi_ if you'd like.

    If everything is successful you should find:
    nagios_multi_ | no | yes (checks hosts services)

5) Run munin-node-configure --suggest --shell
    you can grep for nagios_multi_ if you'd like.

    If everything is successful you should find:
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/nagios_multi_' '/etc/munin/plugins/nagios_multi_checks'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/nagios_multi_' '/etc/munin/plugins/nagios_multi_hosts'

INFORMATION
===========

If you'd like to learn further about the plugin, there is more documentation stored in the
file as POD, you can view this info with perldoc.

If your Nagios setup has passive checks enabled and in use, set the passive to on, this will
change a flag to graph 2 more graphs in regards to passive host / service checks.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Make sure you've setup your munin plugin-conf.d file for the proper runtime variables.

Commonly the user root is needed to interact with nagiostats unless you've changed your
environment to allow a different user to run this binary.
